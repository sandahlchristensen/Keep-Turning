# Keep Turning
/*Keepturning is a series of algorithmically generated wood sculptures. It was designed to investigate our ideas about the concept of post-work.*/ 
We believe that automation is coming wheater we want it or not. Many possible trajectories of this automated future seem bleak and borderline dystopian - Neo-colonial and racist exploitation from the seat of fortress europa, ecologically unsustainable futures build on our dwindling supply of resources, Misogynist futures where our concept of work fail to encompas reproductive labour. However, within the same technology that would enable those futures it is argued that there's potential to reclaim the future and create a post-capitalist society without work.  

Keep Turning is a design-led research project that aims to take the claim of a world without work serious and to explore one possible narative of how this could unfold. It's a proposal for possible post-work activities that can replace the meaning-making activies we have all come to depend of neoliberal capitalism and its business ontology to provide. 

## Post-work
The news serve up a unending flow of dystopian futures[Refferences here]. However some still dare to dream of a future that is not yet cancelled. Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams does exactly that with their book **Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a world without work** [[1]](https://github.com/sandahlchristensen/Keep-Turning/blob/master/references/Srnicek-Williams_Inventing_the_Future.pdf).
